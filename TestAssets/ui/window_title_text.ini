; This file describes the stylesheet of a UI window title for the demo.
; Note: for demonstration purposes it contains all options, but most of them have default values and you don't have to provide.

width = 100%                                 	; Title takes maximum width.
height = 64p                                	; 64 pixels.
padding = 0,0,0,0                           	; add padding from boundaries for child elements.
margin = 0,0,0,6                           	; add extra margin when auto-arranging elements.
origin = 0,0                                    ; origin is top-left corner. this means this element position represents its top-left corner.
anchor = 0,0                                    ; anchor is top-left corner. this means this element position will be set to its parent top-left (+ offset).
