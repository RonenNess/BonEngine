; This file describes the stylesheet of a UI window.
; Note: for demonstration purposes it contains all options, but most of them have default values and you don't have to provide.

; base element stuff
[style]
width = 256p                                 	; 256 pixels.
height = 256p                                	; 256 pixels.
padding = 10,20,10,10                           ; add padding from boundaries for child elements.
origin = 0,0                                    ; origin is top-left corner.

; image element stuff
[image]
image_path = ../TestAssets/ui/window.png         	; image to load.
color = 245,245,245,255     	            		; natural color is slightly darker, so we make it brighter when point on.
color_highlight = 255,255,255,255       		; color when pointing on image.
color_pressed = 255,255,255,255       			; color when pressing on image.
source_rect = 0,0,0,0                                   ; image source rect (all 0 for entire image).
source_rect_highlight = 0,0,0,0                         ; image source rect while being pointed on (all 0 for entire image).
source_rect_pressed = 0,0,0,0                           ; image source rect while being pressed (all 0 for entire image).
blend = alpha                                           ; image blend mode (opaque / alpha / additive / mod / multiply).
type = sliced						; image drawing type (stretch / tiled / sliced).
texture_scale = 4.0					; source image texture scale when in tiled / sliced mode.
sliced_sides = 3,12,3,3					; sides of the sliced image in pixels
